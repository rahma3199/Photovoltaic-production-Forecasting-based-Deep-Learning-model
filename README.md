# Photovoltaic-production-Forecasting-based-Deep-Learning-model

Accurate forecasting of the facility output
of photovoltaic systems during the short term is of great importance for daily/hourly
efficient management of power system production, delivery, and storage, also as for
decision-making on the energy market. This report explores LSTM based RNN to
deal with this challenge. This approach is able to exploit the long term dependen-
cies in the PV production time series for more accurate forecasting. Experiments
are conducted to demonstrate that the model is capable of accurately forecasting
the complex photovoltaic production time series with a long forecasting horizon. Its
performance compares favorably to many other forecasting methods. Historical load
data are used to check the effectiveness of applied methods and the accuracy of ap-
plied methods is calculated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared
Error (MSE).

Photovoltaic forecasting, univariate time series, smart grid, recurrent neural net-
work (RNN), long-short-term memory (LSTM).
